# Signal Acquisition at Higher Sampling Frequency Using the ADCC of the PIC18-Q24 Microcontroller Family

## Introduction

The PIC18-Q24 family of microcontrollers are equipped with a rich set of Core Independent Peripherals (CIP), such as Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation (ADCC), Direct Memory Access (DMA), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) and so on. The integrated ADCC peripheral offers a 10-bit resolution that can handle conversion processes at speeds reaching up to 300 ksps.

The main objective of this code example is to demonstrate the higher data sampling capabilities of the 10-bit ADCC peripheral within the PIC18-Q24 device family, thereby effectively reproducing the sampled input signal. Additionally, it highlights the CIP capabilities of 8-bit PIC® microcontrollers (MCU) by effectively utilizing the ADCC, DMA, SPI and UART peripherals within the code example. Specifically, the DMA peripheral transfers the ADCC conversion results to the SPI peripheral data transmit buffer register without CPU intervention, whereas the SPI is used to output the received ADCC conversion results to the Data Visualizer tool in real time and at a faster rate.

This code example is developed using the PIC18F56Q24 MCU. However, it is relevant to all the 8-bit PIC microcontrollers families that are supported by a 10-bit ADCC module capable of sampling input signals up to 300 ksps.

## Description

<p align="center">
  <img width=auto height=auto src="images/blockdiagram.png">
  <br> <b>Figure 1.</b> Block Diagram<br>
</p>

This section covers the implementation details of the code example. The PIC18F56Q24 Curiosity Nano and Power Debugger boards are used as a development platform. 

Input Signal Generation: A pulse signal is generated using 8-bit buffered Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), DMA, Timer2 (TMR2) and Fixed Voltage Reference (FVR) peripherals of the PIC18F56Q24 microcontroller. The signal is generated by continuously adjusting the output of a DAC to create a pulse signal made of a series of discrete steps. The DMA module has been used for seamless and direct data transfers between different memory regions without intervention from the CPU. The values of the DAC input data register are loaded from Look-up Table (LUT) stored in RAM using DMA. The frequency of the pulse signal is determined by the frequency of updating the DAC DATA register and the total number of points/samples in one cycle of the signal. In this example, the number of data samples per cycle of the pulse signal is set as 100 and is stored in an LUT in RAM memory. This data is transferred to the DAC data register using DMA which is hardware triggered by a Timer2 overflow interrupt occurring every 10 µs.

Therefore, frequency of signal, f = 1 / (Total no of samples per cycle * TMR2 period) = 1/ (100 * 10 µS) = ~1000 Hz.

**Note:** If the number of DAC samples in the pulse signal is kept constant, then the signal frequency can be changed by altering the TMR2 period. 

The DAC output signal is fed to the ADCC input channel through pin RA2.

In this code example, the firmware is developed to sample the input signal at two different sampling frequen ies: 50 ksps and 300 ksps. By default, the ADCC module samples the input signal at 300 ksps sampling frequency, and the user needs to press the on-board mechanical switch (SW0) to change the ADCC sampling frequency to 50 ksps and vice versa. The sampled ADCC conversion data are transmitted to the Data Visualizer in real time through the Data Gateway Interface (DGI) of the power debugger board and reproduce the input signal in the Time Plot window. Additionally, the on-board user LED (LED0) blinks at a specific rate depending on the sampling frequency selection. The instructions for the user to change the sampling frequency via a switch press event, along with the selected sampling frequency value, are transmitted to the Data Visualizer tool using the on-board debugger module and displayed on the Terminal window.

## Firmware Implementation

* The application firmware is developed on the PIC18F56Q24 microcontroller, generated using MPLAB X IDE and MCC. The implemented firmware is performed on the PIC18F56Q24 Curiosity Nano development board. 

* The microcontroller peripherals, TIMERS, ADCC, DAC, FVR, DMA, UART and SPI, are used to implement the functionalities of the ADCC sampling speed demonstration 

* The TMR0 peripheral is used to blink the LED at a specific rate, depending on the sampling frequency selection. At 300 ksps sampling frequency, the LED blinks with a 50 ms delay and, at 50 ksps sampling frequency, the LED blinks with a 200 ms delay.

* The TMR2 peripheral is configured to generate an overflow interrupt for every 10 µs, used to trigger the DMA1 module 

* The TMR2 overflow interrupt acts as trigger source to the DMA1 peripheral instance. The DMA1 module is configured to transmit one byte of data from the LUT, stored in the RAM, to the DAC data register for each TMR2 overflow interrupt. 

* The DAC1 peripheral is configured with FVR as its positive reference and ground as its negative reference and is used to generate an output pulse signal. The output from the DAC1 peripheral is fed as an input to the ADCC module.

* To acquire the input signal, the ADCC module is configured in Basic mode with Fosc as the peripheral clock and FVR as the voltage reference. The ADCC result register (ADRES) is left justified, so the conversion data stored in ADRESH is used for the computation and the data in ADRESL register is ignored.

* The ADCC conversion completion interrupt is configured as a trigger source to the DMA2 peripheral instance. The DMA2 module is configured to transmit the ADCC conversion result to the SPI Transmit buffer register. 

* The SPI1 peripheral is configured as a host with an 8 MHz peripheral clock and used to transmit the ADCC conversion data to the Data Visualizer tool through the Data Gateway Interface (DGI) of the Power Debugger board

* The UART2 peripheral instance is used to display user instructions and the selected sampling rate for the ADCC peripheral in the Terminal window of the Data Visualizer tool

* In the project settings, the XC8 compiler optimization is set to optimization 2, which performs optimizations of all generic code generators and minimal assembly optimizations
